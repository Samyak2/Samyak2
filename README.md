I'm Samyak. Currently studying Computer Science at PES University.

#### Projects that I help maintain:

- [browser-history](https://github.com/pesos/browser-history)
- [grofer](https://github.com/pesos/grofer/)
- [heiko](https://github.com/psiayn/heiko) (and [py-heiko](https://github.com/pesos/heiko))

#### Other projects

I like working on new projects all the time, which also means older projects get abandoned unless there is outside interest. Some of these are course projects, others are more spontaneous.

Some of the projects I'm proud of:
 - [gopy](https://github.com/Samyak2/gopy) - a Go "compiler" implemented in python
 - [guntainer](https://github.com/Samyak2/guntainer) - a rootless container runtime
 - [skip-list](https://github.com/Samyak2/skip-list) - C++ implementation of skip list data structures
 - [par-a-graph](https://github.com/metonymic-smokey/par-a-graph) - parallel pagerank
 - [spressolisp](https://github.com/psiayn/spressolisp) - a lisp interpreter in Rust
 - [numpytorch](https://github.com/Samyak2/numpytorch) - neural network implementation in numpy with a PyTorch-like API
 - [Neural-Network-Julia](https://github.com/Samyak2/Neural-Network-Julia) - with GPU training
 - [SVDNN.jl](https://github.com/Samyak2/SVDNN.jl) - accelerating neural networks using SVD
 - [spatialHashing](https://github.com/psiayn/spatialHashing) - spatial hashing collision detection in python

Some fun projects:
 - [donut](https://github.com/Samyak2/donut) - rendering a donut in the terminal
 - [potential-art](https://github.com/Samyak2/potential-art) - "art" in Julia and Luxor
 - [nvim-config](https://github.com/Samyak2/nvim-config) - my neovim config
 - [guine](https://github.com/Samyak2/guine) - a self-replicating program in Go
